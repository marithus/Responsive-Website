				<h3>Why I recommend this video</h3>
				<br>

				<p> Some may ask why build your own PC when there are services who can do it for you? Well, building
					your own PC will allow you to have a better understanding of your Computer structure,
					and you are doing it for free, no costs, which means u are saving at least $50 - $100. Its easy and
					fun too!
				</p>
				<p>
					Among many amazing build guides videos scattered across the internet, Linus Tech Tips channel have
					never failed to amaze me with their unique idea making their content always stand out
					from the rest and much more interesting. In this video, we will be put in Linus perspective on what
					he is looking at and how he works with his parts. This will allow an immersive experience
					allowing you to have an easier time building your first computer without worrying much. Furthermore,
					you can use the timestamps available in each step to follow through precisely on the process.
				</p>

				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Step 1: Preparations & Things you need <a href="https://youtu.be/v7MYOpFONCU?t=40">0:40</a></h3>
				<br>

				<p>
					First and most important step is to make sure you are in an <b>Anti-Static & Cluster-free work
						Environment</b> when building your beloved PC. You might need to prepare some <b>Phillips screw
						drivers (1)</b>,
					<b>A scissor (2)</b> or something similar, <b>Thermal Compound (3)</b> (if u have an Air Cooler),
					<b>Cable ties (4)</b>(for cable management) and a <b>Tray to store your screws (5)</b> (Magnetic
					would help sorting easier).
				</p>
				<br>
				<img src="images/g/1.png" width="600" height="300">
				<p>
					Once you are done preparing your tool, now you need to ground yourself. To do so, take out your
					<b>Power Supply, turn it off and plug it into a wall socket</b>, touch it every now and then to
					discharge
					any static electricity. If you accidentally zap it on your components, it might destroy them which
					would cause more problems.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now let’s start, open your <b>Motherboard box</b>, take out everything put it safely aside, take
					your Motherboard out of the anti-static bag and place it on top of the motherboard box like Linus
					did.
					Make sure to keep the manual next to you at all time if you run into any problems
				</p>

				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Step 2: CPU Installation <a href="https://youtu.be/v7MYOpFONCU?t=140">2:20</a></h3>
				<br>

				<p>
					Take your <b>CPU</b> gently out of the box, be careful not to drop it. Be careful of the golden pins
					at the bottom of it. Locate the golden triangle, release the retention arm on the motherboard which
					will reveal
					the location where your CPU sit, and align the triangle with the dot or triangle. Rest it there, no
					forces and wiggle it around to make sure it is seated properly.
				</p>

				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Step 3: Ram / memory installation (3:35)</h3>
				<br>

				<p>
					Before you insert your RAM sticks, unlocking the latch on the ram slots (usually the top end),
					<b>check your manual</b> on the best position to put your RAMs in. Slot them in and push them down
					until you hear a click
					on both ends.
				</p>

				<img src="images/g/3.png" height="300">

				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Step 4: SSD installation <a href="https://youtu.be/v7MYOpFONCU?t=254">4:15</a> / HDD installation <a
						href="https://youtu.be/v7MYOpFONCU?t=1365">22:45</a></h3>
				<br>

				<p>
					For M.2 SSD, find the slot for it on your motherboard, if you are unsure please refer to the
					<b>Manual</b>. Use the screws that come with the <b>Motherboard box</b>, to secure the drive on to
					your Motherboard.
				</p>
				<img src="images/g/4.png" height="300">
				<p>
					For HDD and SSD, you will have to install it in the drive cage, which you will need to see in your
					case. Once you install your motherboard, plug the SATA cables to your drives
				</p>

				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Step 5: CPU cooler installation <a href="https://youtu.be/v7MYOpFONCU?t=380">6:20</a></h3>
				<br>

				<p>
					Read your <b>Cooler Manual</b> and check what socket does your motherboard use and take out the
					appropriate parts. Install the bracket behind (depends), install your standoff and brackets to
					prepare for your cooler.
				</p>
				<img src="images/g/5.png" height="300">
				<p>
					For Air cooler, you will need to apply a small amount of thermal compound (as small as your pinky).
					Install your cooler using the manual for both air cooler and AIO. Make sure to screw them tight
					enough so
					that the IHS is in full contact with the heat spreader. Plug the fans cable to your CPU_FAN header
					or AIO_FAN header on your motherboard, use your <b>Motherboard manual</b>.
				</p>

				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Step 6: Prepping the Case <a href="https://youtu.be/v7MYOpFONCU?t=725">12:05</a></h3>
				<br>

				<p>
					Unbox your case, remove your side panels, put them back in a box or on your bed make sure to not
					scratch them. Sort the screws to put it on your <b>Tray</b>, find the front panel connectors and
					prepare them before you
					install them.
				</p>

				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Step 7: Fans Installation <a href="https://youtu.be/v7MYOpFONCU?t=890">14:50</a></h3>
				<br>

				<p>
					Install your fans in a configuration you want, the face where there is the fan chassis will be where
					air is being push and the other is where it will suck in air.
				</p>
				<p>
					In front, you usually want fans to start pulling air from outside and in while the back and top will
					have fans pulling air from inside the case and push it outside. Run the fans cables to where the
					headers
					would be.
				</p>

				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Step 8: Installing motherboard <a href="https://youtu.be/v7MYOpFONCU?t=1020">17:00</a></h3>
				<br>

				<p>
					Install your I/O shield before your motherboard, ensure your standoffs is correctly installed for
					ATX. Now grab your Motherboard, you can hold them from the cooler or the bracket at the back, slide
					it in at
					a 10-degrees angle and line up the I/O to the I/O shield. Lower it down, make sure the standoffs
					lines up correctly to the holes in your motherboard. Now use the screws from the Motherboard box,
					and secure the
					motherboard firmly to the case
				</p>

				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Step 9: Connectors <a href="https://youtu.be/v7MYOpFONCU?t=1200">20:00</a></h3>
				<br>

				<p>
					Now you can plug in all the connectors that u have pre-runed onto the motherboard. USB 3.0/2.0, Fans
					connectors to headers, HD audio, front panel LEDs, SATA Cable, etc. Approach your <b>Motherboard
						manual</b> to which headers can be used.
				</p>

				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Step 10: Power Supply installation <a href="https://youtu.be/v7MYOpFONCU?t=1440">24:00</a></h3>
				<br>

				<p>
					For PSU, you can <b>unplug your power supply</b>, start plugging in cables you need before you slot
					it in for easier installation. Linus did it later because he has a small hand which allow him to
					plug in the cables
					easier but in my experience this is easier. (Refer to <a
						href="https://youtu.be/v7MYOpFONCU?t=1549">25:49</a>) Usually I plug in the 24 pins, 8 pins EPS
					connector (they usually have CPU written on the side), 6+2 pins PCIE express cable and SATA power
					controller
					for your SSD/HDD or RGB controller.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now slide in the power supply, make sure the fan is facing downward if there are ventilation at the
					bottom, otherwise face upward and screw in your power supply with screws from the case
				</p>

				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Step 11: Power Cables <a href="https://youtu.be/v7MYOpFONCU?t=1485">24:45</a></h3>
				<br>

				<p>
					Route your cables, plug the 24 pins power, 8 pins, SATA power controller to the motherboard and
					leave the 6+2 pins PCIE express cable hanging in front of the motherboard. Connect part of your SATA
					power controller
					to your SSD/HDD or RGB controller to power it. This is where you will have to manually, cable
					manage, keep them neatly and use cable ties to secure them on your case to make more tidy and easier
					to install your
					side panel.
				</p>

				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Step 12: Video Cards Installations <a href="https://youtu.be/v7MYOpFONCU?t=1920">32:00</a></h3>
				<br>

				<p>
					Now everyone favourite part, remove the screws from 2 PCI slots cover 1 down from the top to prepare
					for your Graphic Card. Move the tab back align your golden connectors to the slot and push it down
					creating a
					satisfying *click*. Now use the screws you recently remove and secure the Card to the slots and plug
					in the 6+2 pins to your GPU. And you are almost done!
				</p>

				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Step 13: Booting Up and XMP <a href="https://youtu.be/v7MYOpFONCU?t=2120">35:20</a></h3>
				<br>

				<p>
					Organize the cables one more time, <b>do not put on your panels yet</b>. Plug in your Wi-Fi cables/
					LAN cables, mouse, keyboard, monitor and your power cable (make sure your power is on). The scariest
					part power on the
					PC using the power button on the motherboard or your case and power it on. If you see a post screen
					then ‘YAY’ you are safe, if not check all your cables and make sure they have been plugged in
					properly. Now you
					will boot to your bios, you will try to navigate through and find your XMP option and enable it. For
					those who do not have windows installed, I recommend watching <b><a
							href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYYoCXh2gtw&ab_channel=JayzTwoCents">this</a></b>
					video for what to do after.
